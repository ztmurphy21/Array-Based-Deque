Implement a deque as described in Programming Challenge 1, except base your implementation on an array. The 
constructor for the class should  accept an integer parameter for the capacity of the deque and create an array of that size. Use a graphical user interface based on an array of text fields similar to 
what is shown in Figure 21.
